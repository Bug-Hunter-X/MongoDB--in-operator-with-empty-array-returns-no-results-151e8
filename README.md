# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array. The query `db.collection('myCollection').find({ field: { $in: [] } })` is expected to return all documents in the collection. However, it actually returns an empty array.  This is due to how MongoDB evaluates the `$in` operator with an empty array.  A more robust approach is presented in the solution.

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have MongoDB running.
3.  Run `bug.js` to reproduce the issue. Then, run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
